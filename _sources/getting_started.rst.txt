Getting started with BEAT
*************************

General
-------
The beat internal help can always be executed by typing '--help' in the execution string.
Also, by using the 'tab' button you can use automatic bash completion to see available commands and options.
For example::

    beat init --help

Will display::

    Usage: beat init <event_name> <event_date "YYYY-MM-DD"> [options]

    Create a new EQ model project, use only event name to skip catalog search.

Initialise a new Modeling Project
---------------------------------

Each modeling project is initiated with the "beat init" command. There are many options that define the type of optimization, datatypes to include, sampling algorithm to use, number of sources, velocity model to use for the Greens Function calculations etc ...

For example to optimize for a Full Moment Tensor for the Landers EQ by using seismic data, with station dependend Greens Functions for P and S waves with the default sampling algorithm (Sequential Monte Carlo) run::

    beat init LandersEQ 1992-06-28 --datatypes='seismic' --individual_gfs --n_sources=1 --source_type=MTSource --min_mag=7

This will create project directory called LandersEQ in the current directory.
Within the directoy you will see that there have been two files created:
    - BEAT_log.txt 
    - geometry_config.yaml 

The first file is a logging file where all the executed comments and outputs are written to. In case something goes wrong this log file helps to find the error.
For now it contains::

    2018-01-04 16:15:06,696 - utility - INFO - Getting relevant events from the gCMT catalog for the dates:1992-06-27 00:00:00.000 - 1992-06-29 00:00:00.000 

    2018-01-04 16:15:07,097 - config - INFO - Added hyperparameter h_any_P_Z to config and model setup!
    2018-01-04 16:15:07,097 - config - INFO - Added hyperparameter h_any_S_Z to config and model setup!
    2018-01-04 16:15:07,097 - config - INFO - All hyper-parameters ok!
    2018-01-04 16:15:07,097 - config - INFO - Number of hyperparameters! 2

    2018-01-04 16:15:07,102 - config - INFO - Project_directory: /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/LandersEQ 

The second file is a yaml-configuration file and it is where ALL the changes in parameters and settings have to be done to avoid tinkering with the program itself!
This file can be read as is by the computer, therefore, it is important to keep the syntax clean!
The content of this file is basically the serialised instance of the BEAT config class. At first the amount of content seems overwhelming, but once you are familiar with the variables you will find that there are not too many things that will need to be edited. Also we have to be aware that the problem we are going to try to solve is very complex, ergo a complex parameter file is somewhat understandable.
To find a short explanation to each parameter and its format the reader is refered to the webpage of the `config <https://hvasbath.github.io/beat/_modules/config.html#SeismicConfig>`__ module.

This example configuration file looks like this::

Each BEAT config consists of some general information, from information collected from the gCMT catalog, of a ProblemConfig, the configurations for each dataset (here only seismic_config) and configurations for the sampling algorithms to use for the optimizations of the general problem (sampler_config) as well as a of an initial guess for the hyperparameters (hyper_sampler_config).

Most of the edits likely will be made in the ProblemConfig, particularly in the priors of the source parameters. For now only uniform priors are available. To change the bounds of the priors simply type other values into the 'upper' and 'lower' fields of each source parameter. Note: The test parameter needs to be within these bounds! 
To fix one or the other parameter in the optimizations the upper and lower bounds as well as the test value need to be set equal.


Import Data
-----------
This is the step to import the user data into the program format and setup. 

seismic data
____________

So far, unfortunately only the output of `autokiwi <https://github.com/emolch/kiwi>`__ is supported for automatic import of seismic data.
To get other types of data imported the user will have to do some programing.

The following remarks are just bits and pieces that may be followed to write a script to bring the data into the necessary format.

The seismic data may be saved using the package "pickle" as a file "seismic_data.pkl" containing a list of 2 lists: 1. list of "pyrocko.trace.Trace" objects alternating for (Z / T) rotated traces. 2. list of "pyrocko.model.Station" objects in the same order like the data traces.

Pyrocko supports the import of various data formats and all the necessary tools to remove the instrument response and to convert the traces to displacement.
How to do this based on some examples is shown `here <https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/library/examples/trace_handling.html#restitute-to-displacement-using-poles-and-zeros>`__ webpage.

Once you have done this with your data, you only need to create the second list of station objects.
To create this list we provide a helper function 'setup_stations' in the inputf module.
Within an ipython session type::

    from beat import inputf
    inputf.setup_stations?

Will show::

    inputf.setup_stations(lats, lons, names, networks, event)
    Docstring:
    Setup station objects, based on station coordinates and reference event.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lats : :class:`num.ndarray`
        of station location latitude
    lons : :class:`num.ndarray`
        of station location longitude
    names : list
        of strings of station names
    networks : list
        of strings of network names for each station
    event : :class:`pyrocko.model.Event`

    Results
    -------
    stations : list
        of :class:`pyrocko.model.Station`

The event object that may be used in this function is the one shown in the top of the configuration file.
In an ipython session from within the LandersEQ directory execute::

    from pyrocko import guts
    from beat import config

    c = guts.load(filename='config_geometry.yaml')
    print c.event

Will yield::

    --- !pf.Event
    lat: 34.65
    lon: -116.65
    time: 1992-06-28 11:57:53

      mee: 7.001e+19
      mdd: -8.81e+18
      mne: -7.335e+19
      mnd: 3.807e+19

      magnitude: 7.316312340268055
    duration: 38.4


Once a list of traces and station objects exists it may be exported to the project directory (here path from example)::

    from beat import utility

    seismic_outpath='/home/vasyurhm/BEATS/LandersEQ/seismic_data.pkl'
    utility.dump_objects(seismic_outpath, outlist=[stations, data_traces])


How to setup a Custom Greens Function Store
-------------------------------------------
This section covers how to generate a custom Greens Function store for seismic data at a location of choice.
First a new model project has to be created to generate the configuration file. As we have no specific event in mind
we skip the catalog search by not specifiying the date.::

    beat init Cascadia --datatypes='seismic' --mode='geometry' --use_custom

.. note::
    To use the default ak135 earth-model in combination with crust2 one needs to execute above command without the '--use_custom' flag.
 
This will create a beat project folder named 'Cascadia' and a configuration file 'config_geometry.yaml'.
In this configuration file we may now edit the reference location and the velocity model to the specific model we
received from a colleague or found in the literature.::

    cd Cascadia
    vi config_geometry.yaml

This will open the configuration file in the vi editor.
In lines 4-6 we find the reference event::

    event: !pf.Event
      lat: 0.0
      lon: 0.0

In lines 160-165 we find the reference location::

    reference_location: !beat.heart.ReferenceLocation
      lat: 10.0
      lon: 10.0
      elevation: 0.0
      depth: 0.0
      station: Store_Name

The distance between these two locations determines the center point of the grid of Greens Functions that we want to calculate.
For our example we set the reference location close to Vancouver, Canada as we want to study the Cascadia subduction zone.
We ignore the 'elevation' and 'depth' attributes but we set the 'station' attribute, which determines the prefix of the name of the 
Greens Function store. ::

    reference_location: !beat.heart.ReferenceLocation
      lat: 49.28098
      lon: -123.12244
      elevation: 0.0
      depth: 0.0
      station: Vancouver

The events we want to study are going to be around Vancouver island, and we set the reference event coordinates accordingly::

    event: !pf.Event
      lat: 49.608839
      lon: -125.647683

So far we determined the general location of the store, but now we need to specify the spatial dimensions of the grid.
In lines 154-158 we find the respective parameters::

    source_depth_min: 0.0
    source_depth_max: 10.0
    source_depth_spacing: 1.0
    source_distance_radius: 20.0
    source_distance_spacing: 1.0

We are going to have stations in a distance of 500km and the events we are going to study are going to be located in a depth range of 5-40km depth so we update these values accordingly.::

    source_depth_min: 5.0
    source_depth_max: 40.0
    source_depth_spacing: 1.0
    source_distance_radius: 500.0
    source_distance_spacing: 1.0

To decide on the resolution of the grid and the sample_rate (line 167) depends on the use-case and aim of the study. 
A description of the corner points to have in mind is `here <https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/apps/fomosto/tutorial.html#considerations-for-real-world-applications>`__
For example for a regional Full Moment Tensor inversion we want to optimize data up to 0.2 Hz. So a source grid of 1. km step size and 1. Hz 'sample_rate' seems a safe way to go.
As we are in a regional setup we use QSEIS for the calculation of the Greens Functions, which we have to specify in line 166.::

    code: qseis

In the lines 144-153 is the velocity model defined for which the Greens Functions are going to be calculated.::

The columns are 'depth', 'p-wave velocity', 's-wave velocity', 'density', 'Qp', 'Qs'. Here the values may be changed to a custom velociy.
For example if we want to add another layer (from 20-25 km depth) between 20 and 35 km depth we would write::

Below the specified depth it is going to be combined with the earth-model specified in line 141.

.. note::
    In case the standard earth-model should be used rather than a custom model the 'custom_velocity_model' attribute may be deleted.
    For the shallow crust one may decide to use the implemented crust2 model and to remove (potential) water layers. Lines 141-143::

        earth_model_name: ak135-f-average.m
        use_crust2: false 
        replace_water: false

Then, we have to specify under line 135 'store_superdir' the path to the directory where to save the GreensFunction store on disk. 
One should have in mind that for large grids with high sample-rate the stores might become several GigaBytes in size and may calculate a very long time!

Lastly, we start the store calculation with::

    beat build_gf Cascadia --execute --datatypes='seismic'
