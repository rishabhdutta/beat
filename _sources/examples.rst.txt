The example scenarios are located in the directory::

     beat/data/examples

In the following tutorials we will use synthetic example data to get familiar with the basic functionality of BEAT.


Regional Full Moment Tensor
---------------------------
Clone project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This setup is comprised of 20 seismic stations that are randomly distributed within distances of 40 to 1000 km compared to a reference event.
To copy the scenario (including the data) to a directory outside of the package source directory, please edit the 'model path' (referred to as $beat_models now on) and execute::

    cd /path/to/beat/data/examples/
    beat clone FullMT /'model path'/FullMT --copy_data

This will create a BEAT project directory named 'FullMT' with a configuration file (config_geometry.yaml) and some synthetic example data (seismic_data.pkl).
This directory is going to be referred to as '$project_directory' in the following.

Calculate Greens Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The station-event geometry determines the grid of Greens Functions (GFs) that will need to be calculated next.

Please open $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml with any text editor (e.g. vi) and check the line 144: store_superdir. Here is written for now /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/GF, which is an example path to the directory of Greens Functions.
This path needs to be replaced with the path to where the GFs are supposed to be stored on your computer. This directory is refered to as the $GF_path in the rest of the text. It is strongly recommended to use a seperate directory apart from the beat source directory and the $project_directory as the GF databases can become very large, depending on the problem! For real examples, the GF databases may require up to several Gigabyte of free disc space. For our example the database that we are going to create is only around 30 Megabyte.:: 

    cd $beat_models
    beat build_gfs FullMT --datatypes='seismic'

This will create an empty Greens Function store named AqabaMT_ak135_1.000Hz_0 in the $GF_path. Under $GF_path/AqabaMT_ak135_1.000Hz_0/config it is recommended to cross-check again the velocity model and the specifications of the store (open with any texteditor).
Dependend on the case study there are crucial parameters that often need to be changed from the default values: the spatial grid dimensions, the sample rate and the wave phases (body waves and/or surface waves) to be calculated.

In the $project_path/config_geometry.yaml under seismic config we find the gf_config, which holds the major parameters for GF calculation::

  gf_config: !beat.SeismicGFConfig
    store_superdir: /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/GF/
    reference_model_idx: 0
    n_variations: [0, 1]
    error_depth: 0.1
    error_velocities: 0.1
    depth_limit_variation: 600.0
    earth_model_name: ak135-f-average.m
    use_crust2: false
    replace_water: false
    custom_velocity_model: |2
          0.             5.51           3.1            2.6         1264.           600.
          7.2            5.51           3.1            2.6         1264.           600.
          7.2            6.23           3.6            2.8         1283.           600.
         21.64           6.23           3.6            2.8         1283.           600.

    source_depth_min: 8.0
    source_depth_max: 8.0
    source_depth_spacing: 1.0
    source_distance_radius: 1000.0
    source_distance_spacing: 1.0
    nworkers: 4
    reference_location: !beat.heart.ReferenceLocation
      lat: 29.07
      lon: 34.73
      elevation: 0.0
      depth: 0.0
      station: AqabaMT
    code: qseis
    sample_rate: 1.0
    rm_gfs: true

Here we see that instead of the global velocity model ak135 a custom velocity model is going to be used for all the stations.
Below are the grid definitions of the GFs. In this example the source depth grid is limited to one depth (8 km) to reduce calculation time.
As we have stations up to a distance of 970km distance to the event, the distance grid is accordingly extending up to 1000km.
These grid sampling parameters as well as the sample rate are of major importance for the overall optimization. How to adjust these parameters
according to other case studies is described `here <https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/apps/fomosto/tutorial.html#considerations-for-real-world-applications>`__.

The 'nworkers' variable defines the number of CPUs to use in parallel for the GF calculations. As these calculations may become very expensive and time-consuming it is of advantage to use as many CPUs as available. To be still able to navigate in your Operating System without crashing the system it is good to leave one CPU work-less. Please edit the 'nworkers' parameter now! 

For our use-case the grid specifications are fine for now.

The seismic phases for which the GFs are going to be calculated are defined under 'waveforms' in the $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml there are ::

      - !beat.WaveformFitConfig
        include: true
        name: any_P
        channels: [Z]
        filterer: !beat.heart.Filter
          lower_corner: 0.01
          upper_corner: 0.1
          order: 3
        distances: [0.0, 9.0]
        interpolation: multilinear
        arrival_taper: !beat.heart.ArrivalTaper
          a: -20.0
          b: -10.0
          c: 250.0
          d: 270.0

In this case the GFs are going to be calculated for the P body waves. We can add additional WaveformFitConfig(s) if we want to include more phases. Like in our case of a regional setup we would like to include surface waves. For the build_GFs command only the existence of the WaveformFitConfig and the name are of importance and we can ignore the other parameters so far. So lets add to the $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml file, the following config. Please copy .. ::

      - !beat.WaveformFitConfig
        include: true
        name: slowest
        channels: [Z]
        filterer: !beat.heart.Filter
          lower_corner: 0.001
          upper_corner: 0.1
          order: 4
        distances: [30.0, 90.0]
        interpolation: multilinear
        arrival_taper: !beat.heart.ArrivalTaper
          a: -15.0
          b: -10.0
          c: 50.0
          d: 55.0

and paste it below the 'any_P' WaveformFitConfig. Note: You should be having 2 WaveformFitConfig entries and both entries MUST have the same indentation!
Your seismic_config within the $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml should look like this::

    seismic_config: !beat.SeismicConfig
      datadir: ./
      blacklist: []
      calc_data_cov: true
      pre_stack_cut: true
      waveforms:
      - !beat.WaveformFitConfig
        include: true
        name: any_P
        channels: [Z]
        filterer: !beat.heart.Filter
          lower_corner: 0.01
          upper_corner: 0.1
          order: 3
        distances: [0.0, 9.0]
        interpolation: multilinear
        arrival_taper: !beat.heart.ArrivalTaper
          a: -20.0
          b: -10.0
          c: 250.0
          d: 270.0
      - !beat.WaveformFitConfig
        include: true
        name: slowest
        channels: [Z]
        filterer: !beat.heart.Filter
          lower_corner: 0.001
          upper_corner: 0.1
          order: 4
        distances: [30.0, 90.0]
        interpolation: multilinear
        arrival_taper: !beat.heart.ArrivalTaper
          a: -15.0
          b: -10.0
          c: 50.0
          d: 55.0

Now the store configuration files have to be updated. As we created them before we need to overwrite them! We can do this with the --force option.::

    beat build_gfs FullMT --datatypes='seismic' --force

Checking again the store config under $GF_path/AqabaMT_ak135_1.000Hz_0/config shows the phases that are going to be calculated::

    tabulated_phases:
    - !pf.TPDef
      id: any_P
      definition: p,P,p\,P\
    - !pf.TPDef
      id: slowest
      definition: '0.8'

Finally, we are good to start the GF calculations!::

    beat build_gfs FullMT --datatypes='seismic' --force --execute

Depending on the number of CPUs that have been assigned to the job this may take few minutes.

Next we can use the 'fomosto' tool together with 'snuffler' to inspect if the GFs look reasonable. To plot the 10 elementary GF components in a depth of 8km at a distance of 500km::

    fomosto view $GF_path/AqabaMT_ak135_1.000Hz_0 --extract='8k,500k'

This looks reasonably well!

 .. image:: _static/fomosto_traces_snuffler.png


Sample the solution space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once we are confident that the GFs are reasonable we may continue to define the optimization specific setup variables.
First of all we check again the WaveformFitConfig for the waves we want to optimize. 
In this case we want to optimize the whole waveform from P until the end of the surface waves.
As the wavetrains are very close in the very near field we do not want to have overlapping time windows, which is why we deactivate one of the WaveformFitConfigs, by setting
include=False on the `slowest` WaveformfitConfig. So please open again $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml (if you did close the file again) and edit the respective parameter!

Also there we may define a distance range of stations taken into account,
define a bandpass filter and a time window with respect to the arrival time of the respective wave.
Therefore, stations that are used to optimize the P-wave do not necessarily need to be used to optimize the surface waves by defining different distance ranges.
Similarly, different filters and arrival time windows maybe defined as well. These parameters are all fine for this case here!

The optimization is done in the R, T, Z rotated coordinate system to better tune, which part of the waves are optimized. That is particularly important if the S-wave
is going to be used, as one would typically use only SH waves which are the S-waves in the T-component.
For P-waves one would like to use the Z(vertical) component and for surface waves both components.
So please make sure that in $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml under the WaveformFitConfig (name 'any_P') the channels list contains [Z, T] (including the brackets!)!  

Finally, we fix the depth prior to 8km (upper and lower) as we only calculated GFs for that depth. $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml under the point 'priors'::

    priors:
      depth: !beat.heart.Parameter
        name: depth
        form: Uniform
        lower: [8.0]
        upper: [8.0]
        testvalue: [8.0]

Of course, in a real case this would not be fixed.
Also we may inspect the data::

    beat check FullMT --what='traces'

This should open again the 'snuffler' window and you can interactively scroll through the traces zoom in and out, filter the traces and much more.
A detailed tutorial about handeling the browser is given `here <https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/apps/snuffler/tutorial.html>`__.

  .. image:: _static/FullMT_data.png

For example you can also right click in the window and see a menu that pops up. There you can select sort the traces by distance or azimuth to get a better picture of the setup.
Now that we checked the optimization setup we are good to go.

Firstly, we fix the source parameters to some random value and only optimize for the hyperparameters (HPs).
How many different random source parameters are choosen and the sampling repeated is determined by the hyper_sampler_config parameters 'n_stages' (default:5) ::

    beat sample FullMT --hypers

This reduces the initial search space from 40 orders of magnitude to usually 5 to 10 orders. Checking the $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml,
the HPs parameter bounds show something like::

    hyperparameters:
      h_any_P_T: !beat.heart.Parameter
        name: h_any_P_T
        form: Uniform
        lower: [-4.0]
        upper: [5.0]
        testvalue: [0.5]
      h_any_P_Z: !beat.heart.Parameter
        name: h_any_P_Z
        form: Uniform
        lower: [-4.0]
        upper: [5.0]
        testvalue: [0.5]

At this point the bounds could be relaxed again as well by manually editing the configuration file, or the step could be entirely skipped.
Now that we have an initial guess on the hyperparameters we can run the optimization using the default sampling algorithm, a Sequential Monte Carlo sampler.
The sampler can effectively exploit the parallel architecture of nowadays computers. The 'n_jobs' number should be set to as many CPUs as possible in the configuration file.
Note: 'n_chains' divided by 'n_jobs' MUST yield a whole number! An error is going to be thrown if this is not the case!::

    sampler_config: !beat.SamplerConfig
      name: SMC
      progressbar: true
      parameters: !beat.SMCConfig
        n_chains: 500
        n_steps: 100
        n_jobs: 1
        tune_interval: 10
        coef_variation: 1.0
        stage: 0
        proposal_dist: MultivariateNormal
        check_bnd: true
        update_covariances: false
        rm_flag: true

Dependend on the hardware, sampler specifications and number of jobs that have been defined, this calculation is going to take few hours.
Therefore, in order to avoid crashes or in the case of remote connection via ssh it is very much recommended to use something like 'screen'
to detach the terminal where the process is running. For now we do not do that, simply run::

    beat sample FullMT

The sampling is successfully finished if the screen shows something like this::

    ...
    backend      - INFO     Loading multitrace from /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/FullMT/geometry/stage_25
    smc          - INFO     Beta > 1.: 1.293753                      
    smc          - INFO     Sample final stage

    paripool     - INFO     Feierabend! Done with the work!
    backend      - INFO     Loading multitrace from /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/FullMT2/geometry/stage_-1
    smc          - INFO     Finished sampling!    


Restarting sampling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For one or the other reason it may happen that sampling crashes and you will want to restart at the point where it crashed.
Otherwise all the sampling that has been done before would be lost. First you have to find out in which 'stage' of the sampling the
algorithm crashed. You can do this in two ways. Either by checking the output to the screen of the terminal where you did run the job.
If that is not available anymore check the last lines of the $project_directory/BEAT_log.txt. Open it in any texteditor and go to the end of the file.  
There might be written for example::

    2018-01-09 20:05:26,749 - backend - INFO - Loading multitrace from /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/FullMT/geometry/stage_19
    2018-01-09 20:05:32,035 - smc - INFO - Beta: 0.117085 Stage: 20
    2018-01-09 20:05:32,035 - smc - INFO - Initialising 400 chain traces ...
    2018-01-09 20:05:32,355 - smc - INFO - Sampling ...

This means that the algorithm crashed in 'stage' 20. To restart from this stage please open $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml and got to
the 'sampler_config'. There under 'parameters' must be a parameter 'stage'. At this point if the algorithm has been started from the beginning there should be
'0'. So here we put now 20 as we want to restart in stage 20. As we want to keep all the previous sampling results of that stage, we have to make sure that again under 
'parameters' the flag 'rm_flag' shows 'false'! If 'true', all the previous sampling results will be deleted in the course of new sampling.
Now that we redefined the starting point of the sampling algorithm we are good to start the sampling again.::

    beat sample FullMT


Summarize the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following command will create a summary with the statistics of the posterior distribution expressed in quantiles.::

    beat summarize FullMT

If you check the summary.txt file (path then also printed to the screen)::

    vi $project_directory/geometry/summary.txt

For example for the 'north_shift' the true value is 20. The posterior pdf quantiles show::

    north_shift:

      Mean             SD               MC Error         95% HPD interval
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      19.989           0.010            0.000            [19.972, 20.012]

      Posterior quantiles:
      2.5            25             50             75             97.5
      |--------------|==============|==============|--------------|
      
      19.969         19.982         19.990         19.996         20.010

As this is a synthetic case with only little noise it is not particularly surprising to get such a steeply peaked distribution.


Plotting
^^^^^^^^
Now to the point that you all have been waiting for ;) the result in pictures.
To see the waveform fit of the posterior maximum likelihood solution. In the $beat_models run::

    beat plot FullMT waveform_fits

If it worked it will produce a pdf with several pages output for all the components for each station that have been used in the optimization.
The black waveforms are the unfiltered data. Red are the best fitting synthetic traces. Light grey and light red are the filtered, untapered
data and synthetic traces respectively. The red data trace below are the residual traces between data and synthetics. 
The Z-components from our stations should look something like this.

  .. image:: _static/FullMT_waveforms_max.png

The following command produces a '.png' file with the final posterior distribution. In the $beat_models run::

    beat plot FullMT stage_posteriors --reference --stage_number=-2 --format='png'

It may look like this.

 .. image:: _static/FullMT_stage_-2_max.png

 The vertical black lines are the true values and the vertical red lines are the maximum likelihood values.
 We see that the true solution is not comprised within the posterior pdfs. This may have several reasons I will not go in to detail for now.

 To get an image of parameter correlations (including the true reference value in red) of moment tensor components, the location and the magnitude. In the $beat_models run::

    beat plot FullMT correlation_hist --reference --format='png' --stage_number=-2 --varnames='mee, med, mdd, mnn, mnd, mne, north_shift, east_shift, magnitude'

This will show an image like that.

 .. image:: _static/FullMT_corr_hist_max.png

This shows 2d kernel density estimates (kde) and histograms of the specified model parameters. The darker the 2d kde the higher the probability of the model parameter.
THe red dot and the vertical red lines show the true values of the target source in the kde plots and histograms, respectively.

The 'varnames' option may take any parameter that has been optimized for. For example one might als want to try --varnames='duration, time, magnitude, north_shift, east_shift'
